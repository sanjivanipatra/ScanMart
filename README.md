A web application is created using Flask which takes an input of an image(grocery item) and displays the name of the grocery item. In later stages, the name of the grocery item would be mapped to prices and the total amount would be displayed. To identify the grocery items, we have used a neural network model.

Grocery apps would appeal more to people if they could just click a picture of the grocery item they want to buy and the order happens automatically. This approach would eliminate the need of complex interfaces and provide the end-users with a working product with minimal complexity. For the elderly living alone or unable to travel, an application like this would ease their day-to-day lives.
